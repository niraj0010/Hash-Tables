Designed a hash table and implemented a suitable hash function for efficient storage and retrieval of character data. Experimented with different sizes of the table and meticulously tracked the number of collisions that occurred in each instance.

Evaluated hash collisions by populating the hash table with identical data across varying table sizes.
